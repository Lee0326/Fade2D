Fade2D, v1.74, 2019, March 19th
===============================

Welcome to the Fade2D Library!

The present download contains all library versions for
 
.) Windows (VS2010, VS2012, VS2013, VS2015, VS2017) 
.) Linux (gcc) for PC and Raspberry PI 
.) Apple (clang)

Getting started
===============

The present directory contains small, well documented C++ examples that 
cover the different topics:

* Visual Studio:
----------------
Open a solution file 

  examples_2D/vs20xx_exampleProject/examples_2D.sln   
  examples_25D/vs20xx_exampleProject/examples_25D.sln   

For maximum performance compile in x64 Release mode. Find the executable 
in fadeRelease/x64 and run it in a command line window (cmd.exe). When
you link the library with your own software you can use the same settings
that you find in the example solutions. 

VS2010 - version 10 - toolset v100 or Windows7.1SDK
VS2012 - version 11 - toolset v110 
VS2013 - version 12 - toolset v120
VS2015 - version 14 - toolset v140
VS2017 - version 15 - toolset v141


* Linux and Apple users: 
------------------------
cd examples_2D   (or examples_25D)

Attention: You must choose your Linux distribution, Apple or Raspberry
PI in the Makefile. If a specific Linux distro is not listed try a 
similar one please. 

$> make
$> ./allExamples_2D   (or ./allExamples_25D)




Directories
===========

.) include_fade2d and include_fade25d
Header files of the two libraries. 

.) x64 (Win32)
The *.dll and *.lib files. This is also the output directory for the
example executables compiled with Visual Studio.

.) lib_${DISTRO}_${ARCHITECTURE}
The shared libraries (*.so) for Linux and (*.dylib) Apple developers. The 
libraries work for a wide range of Linux distributions. Commercial users 
who need support for a certain additional Linux distribution: Please get 
in contact with the author. 

.) examples_2D
Source code of all examples using Fade2D

.) examples_25D
Source code of all examples using Fade2.5D

.) doc

Documentation
=============

The example source codes are documented here:

   http://www.geom.at/fade-delaunay-triangulation/

and you can find the HTML documentation of the library here:

Student license
===============

Fade is free of charge for personal non-commercial research. But we ask 
you to put a link to Fade on your research homepage or project page and to 
cite Fade2D in scientific publications using it. Fade is not free software. Do
not integrate it in a free software project without explicit permission.

Limits of the student version:
------------------------------
2D triangulation: 1 million points
2.5D triangulation: 100 000 points
Meshing: 50 000 output triangles
Cut&Fill: 50 000 triangles
SegmentChecker: 50 000 segments

Not enough for evaluation purposes? You can ask the author for an extended 
evaluation license if your project requires larger limits. Please describe 
your project and include a link to your research homepage then. 




Commercial license
==================

All other applications, including commercial in-house usage, require a 
commercial license which has the advantage of maintenance, error corrections 
and personal support. The commercial license of Fade consists of one base 
component and several optional components:

* The Fade2D base component (mandatory): It covers 2D Delaunay triangulations 
and constrained Delaunay triangulations. Zones and the SegmentChecker module
are included. 

* The mesh generator and grid mesher (optional): Creates high quality triangles 
inside a specified area. The methods refine() and refineAdvanced() belong to 
this component.

* The Fade2.5D extension (optional): For terrains and other height fields: 
Points have (x,y,z)-coordinates, ISO lines (contours in a terrain having the 
same height) can be computed and the height values of arbitrary (x,y) pairs
can be queried quickly. The above mentioned meshing extension can take 
advantage of the height values when a height field shall be filled with
high quality triangles.

* The Cut&Fill software for earthwork calculations (optional): Cut-And-Fill 
computes the volume between two overlapping TINâ€™s.

* The Segment Checker module is included in the base component but also 
available as a separate component without Delaunay triangulation: Given
a set of 2D or 2.5D line segments it identifies intersecting segments.
