Makefile Users
--------------

Choose Apple, your Linux distro or Raspberry PI in the Makefile. If your
specific Linux distro is not listed, try a similar one (there is almost
always a compatible one). 

Visual Studio Users
-------------------

Open the solution file vs20xx_exampleProject/*.sln with Visual Studio.
For best performance compile in x64 Release mode, find the executable
in the fadeRelease_vXX/x64 folder and start it from the command line
(cmd.exe)
